# Arduino Door Lock Project-Pierce McKinnon
Welcome to my Arduino Door Lock Project!  
  
This project involves creating an automated door locking system for my apartment room.
[This](https://github.com/PierceMckinnon/Arduino-PierceMcKinnon/blob/master/Door%20Lock/Lock.ino) is the code which controls the system and was written in the Arduino IDE.
